Checksums to Dups
=================

The script processes a tab-delimited checksum manifest and,
for each directory represented counts the number of files and
how many are duplicates.

Written for the [June 2013 OPF Hackathon](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/x/K4BpAQ). 

*Note*: The script started as an attempt to create the JSON data
needed to feed a TreeMap visualization but was reduced in
scope to this solution to fit time constraints.
